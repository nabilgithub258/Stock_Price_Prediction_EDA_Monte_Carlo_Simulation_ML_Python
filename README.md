# Stock Price Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock prices for four major companies: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG). The analysis includes historical data retrieval, profit calculation, moving averages analysis, and future price prediction using Monte Carlo simulation.

## Data Source
We retrieved one year of historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 2023 to 2024.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Retrieval**: Collected historical stock prices for AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOG from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Percentage Change Calculation**: Computed the percentage change in closing prices to analyze the profit trends for each stock.
3. **Moving Averages**: Calculated moving averages for periods ranging from 10 to 80 days, with increments of 10 days, to identify trends and smooth out short-term fluctuations.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Plotted various graphs to visualize the relationships between the stocks and identified the highest correlation between GOOG and AMZN.
5. **Price Prediction**: Utilized Monte Carlo simulation to predict future stock prices for all four stocks, providing a probabilistic approach to forecast potential future movements.

## Repository Contents
- **Code/**: Jupyter notebooks documenting each step of the analysis, including data retrieval, percentage change calculation, moving averages, correlation analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations.
- **Code/**: Python scripts used for data processing and analysis.
- **Plots/**: This file, providing an overview of all the plots we did.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of stock price trends and predictions for four major companies. By examining percentage changes, moving averages, and leveraging Monte Carlo simulations, we gain insights into historical performance and future price potential.
